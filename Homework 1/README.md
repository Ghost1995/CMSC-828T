# Homework 1

**Problem Statement**

Given a set of noisy observation measurements of landmarks and odometry data, simultaneously estimate the robot pose and landmark locations in the world frame. The inputs can be found in the HW1.mat file.
Note that the noise in robot's translational movement is 30% and in rotational movement is 10% of the movement. Moreover, the camera/distance sensors are not perfect in nature. The error in estimating the distance from the robot to the landmark can be assumed to be about 0.1 metre in both X and Y direction. Assume all noise to be modelled by Gaussian distribution of zero mean.

**Running the Code**

Simply run Wrapper.m script
